For non-web applications wishing to access Ubuntu One APIs, the Ubuntu SSO service will provide the best user experience for acquiring an OAuth access token. Rather than bouncing the user through a web site, it allows the application to query the user for their email address and password.

An unofficial Ubuntu One app for Maemo 5 and other Qt-enabled platforms.
The Ubi app provides access to Ubuntu One cloud service. Initial version supports simple storage management tasks like: file Download, Upload and Deletion. The plan is to provide other cloud features i.e. Notes editing and Contact synchronization.
The code is mostly done in Qt Quick so hopefully it can be easily migrated to Symbian or MeeGo platforms.
